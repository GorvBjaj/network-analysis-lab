# Network Analysis lab



##### Overview:

A Hands-on lab to learn how network packets behave when system is under attack because of network vulnerabilities.

Using Isolated Virtual Machines.



##### Lab Environment:

* Kali Linux (Attacker)
* Ubuntu (Victim)
* Internal Network (Static IP's)



##### Attacks Covered:

* TCP SYN Flood
* ARP Spoofing
* Network Discovery (Nmap)

##### 

##### Major Steps Involved:

* Create and Install Two different virtual machines (Kali Linux and Ubuntu)
* Configure Them on isolated internal networks then Assign static IP's manually.
* Verify Connectivity Using Network Discovery.
* Launch Attacks From Kali Linux to Victim.
* Capture and analyze packets on Ubuntu using Wireshark.
* Saved Packet captures for Further analysis.
